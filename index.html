    <h1>Turtles</h1>
   
    <p>Turtles spend most of their lives in water. They are adapted for aquatic life, with webbed feet or flippers and a streamlined body. Sea turtles rarely leave the ocean, except to lay eggs in the sand. Freshwater turtles live in ponds and lakes, and they climb out of the water onto logs or rocks to bask in the warm sun.</p>

    <h1> Tortoises vs Turtles</h1>
    

    <p>
      First let us get one thing straight, all tortoises are turtles but all turtles are not tortoises. They but belong to the family Testudines or Chelonia, which are reptiles that have bony shells. Though this is true one of the main diffrences between turtles and tortises is that tortises are land animals. Also tortises do not have webbed limbs like turtles. If you are ever trying to help a turtle or a tortoise make sure you know which one it is.</p>
